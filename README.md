Exploring Novel Applications and Modifications to the "Information Sieve"

In this project, we propose to explore novel applications and possibly improvements to the
"Information Sieve" first described by Greg Ver Steeg and Adam Galsyan. The Information
Sieve is a method for unsupervised learning that passes data through a series of progressively 
fine "sieves" where each layer of the sieve recovers a single latent factor that is maximally 
informative about multivariate dependence in the data. Current applications mentioned in the
paper include its use in discrete Independent Component Analysis, lossy and lossless compression, 
and signal processing.
